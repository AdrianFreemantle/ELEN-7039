This is a “capstone” course in the “MEng in Information/Software Engineering” Programme. The
objective is that students will undertake a design exercise that integrates knowledge accumulated
in all of the “core” modules in the MEng programme. The design exercise also requires the
student to proceed with minimal supervision or assistance.

Course Outcomes
On successful completion of this course, the student is capable of:
1. Identifying requirements, assumptions, success criteria and constraints that characterize
the selected software design problem. The ability to contextualize the design with respect
to relevant literature and existing solutions is also essential.
2. Developing a software design that meets expected quality objectives, such as
functionality, maintainability and reliability.
3. Develop a design that displays evidence of originality and a suitable degree of attention
to detail.
4. Applying an appropriate engineering methodology to arrive at acceptable design outputs.
5. Validating and critically reviewing the final design output against the original
requirements and acceptable quality objectives.
6. Making suitable tradeoffs.
7. Demonstrate an understanding of how the design may be implemented.
8. Presenting the design as a professional technical document, using accepted industry
notations.
