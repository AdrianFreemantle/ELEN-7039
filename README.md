Debit Orders provide a cost effective and convenient way for South African consumers to pay for services such as long-term insurance policies, with 48 million Debit Orders Debit Orders to the value of R61 billion being processed each month in South Africa. The current Debit Order process is open to abuse as written and voice recorded Debit Order mandates do not verify that the individual granting the mandate is the legal owner of the bank account, resulting in 8% of transactions being disputed. The South African Reserve Bank and the Payments Association of South Africa have launched the Authenticated Collections process to replace the Debit Order process. Transitioning to Authenticated Collections poses a challenge for many companies whose existing Debit Order processes are implemented on legacy platforms. 

This paper presents the design of a Billings System for a long-term insurer with an established legacy position. The Domain-Driven Design concept of a Bounded Context is used to extract an explicit Billings Domain Model from a legacy system, allowing the new model to evolve over time without affecting legacy functionality. The design is shown to be extensible, flexible, and maintainable and advantages and disadvantages of applying Domain-Driven Design techniques to replacing legacy systems functionality is discussed.
